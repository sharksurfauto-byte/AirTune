🎵 AirTune – Hand Gesture Controlled Musical Instrument

AirTune is a real-time, computer vision–based musical instrument that allows users to create music using hand gestures captured through a webcam. Built using Python, MediaPipe, OpenCV, and Pygame, this project detects hand landmarks and maps specific finger movements to musical notes, enabling an interactive and touchless music experience.

The system tracks hand positions in real time, identifies finger gestures, and triggers corresponding audio samples, effectively turning hand movements into sound. This project demonstrates the practical application of computer vision, gesture recognition, and human–computer interaction in an intuitive and creative way.
